# Liar Game

A website where you can play the Liar Game.

## Motivation for Creating This

In the past, I played a game called "Liar Game" with close friends. It was really fun, and when I wanted to play it again with other friends, the apps that helped facilitate the Liar Game were only available for Android. Since most of us were iPhone users, it was difficult for us to play. To address this issue, I created this web-based game so that many users can easily access and play the game.

When I originally created this game, it was purely for study purposes and for enjoying it with my friends. Creating it was a great learning experience, and even after 5 years, many users still visit the site. Now, I've decided to update this precious memory from the past to develop it further. Please enjoy and visit often. Thank you.

## Development

### Update on February 25, 2024

Originally using React.js, I've now updated the project to Next.js. I've simplified the tech stack to improve efficiency and eliminate unnecessary server usage during development. The backend uses Firebase (Next.js + Firebase).

### Previous Updates

This project was built with React.js. I personally use `yarn` when working with it.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.  
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.  
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.  
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.  
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
