Extract a structured list of major NYC events that happened or are happening in the period between {START_DATE} and {END_DATE} (today).
Focus only on events that gained at least regional interest - events that tourists would plan trips around or locals mark on calendars.
Or went really Viral on social media.

IMPORTANT: 
- Keep event names to 1-3 words only (e.g., "US Open", "Summer Streets", "Fashion Week")
- Quality over quantity - if there are only 3-7 truly notable events, that's perfect. Do not pad the list
