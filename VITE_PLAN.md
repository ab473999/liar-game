# Vite Frontend Migration Plan

## Overview
Complete migration from Next.js (JavaScript) to Vite + React + TypeScript with Zustand state management.

**Important**: Application is **English-only**. All multi-language support has been removed from the backend.

### Migration Strategy
- **Parallel Development**: Run both frontends simultaneously during migration
- **Incremental Migration**: Build and test one page/feature at a time
- **Port Configuration**: 
  - Current Next.js: Port 3000
  - New Vite: Port 5173 (default Vite port)
- **Final Cutover**: Delete old frontend, rename frontend-vite → frontend, update nginx

## IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES (Updated Dec 2024)

### 1. Settings Page (/settings) - ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] Add new theme functionality (name input, auto-generate type)
- [x] Display list of existing themes (clickable to navigate)
- [ ] Show/hide AI themes toggle
- [x] Navigation to /settings/[theme.type] on theme click
- [x] Background sync with backend (smart sync solution)

### 2. Theme Settings Page (/settings/[theme.type]) - 🚀 TOP PRIORITY
Build individual theme management page with:

   - Game (word reveal for all players)
   - Settings (theme management)
   - Theme Settings (word management)

2. **State Management**
   - Player count
   - Theme selection
   - Game flow state
   - Skin/theme switching
   - ~~Language support~~ (Removed - English only)
   - Loading states

3. **UI Systems**
   - Responsive layout system
   - Dark/light/custom skins via CSS variables
   - Tailwind utility classes
   - Icon system (Lucide React)

## Game Mechanics & Navigation Flow

### How the Liar Game Works
The Liar Game is a social deduction party game where:
1. **Setup**: Players select the number of participants and choose a theme
2. **Word Reveal**: Each player privately views their role:
   - Normal players see the secret word
   - One random player (the liar) sees "You are the Liar" instead
3. **Real-Life Discussion**: Players discuss the topic without saying the word directly
4. **Voting**: Players vote on who they think is the liar (happens in person)

### Navigation Flow
```
Home (/)
   │
   ├─[Select Players & Theme]
   │
   ▼
Game (/game)
   │
   ├─Word Reveal Phase
   │  └─Each player takes turn viewing word/role
   │
   └─Options (after all players revealed)
      ├─→ Back to Home (/) - Start new game
      └─→ Replay - Re-do word reveal with same setup
   
Settings (/settings)
   └─[Standalone page for game configuration]
      ├─ Manage themes
      ├─ Add/edit/delete words
      └─ Change UI skin
```

**Note**: The discussion and voting happen in real life, not in the app. The app's role ends after all players have viewed their word/role.

## Technical Decisions

### WordReveal Component Architecture
The WordReveal system implements a sophisticated press-and-hold mechanic with clean separation of concerns:

#### Component Structure:
```
components/functional/WordReveal/
├── hooks.ts              # usePressAndHold - reusable press-and-hold logic
├── index.ts              # Barrel exports
├── WordRevealCircle.tsx  # Circle button with press-and-hold handlers
└── WordRevealText.tsx    # Text display (word/liar) with conditional rendering
```

#### Press-and-Hold Flow:
1. **Initial State**: Text is hidden, white circle button visible
2. **Press Start**: User begins holding the circle
3. **During Hold**: Progress logged every 250ms
4. **1s Reached**: `revealWord()` called → `isWordRevealed: true` in store → text appears
5. **Release**: If held for 1s+, `nextPlayer()` called → advances to next player
6. **Next Player**: `isWordRevealed: false` → text hidden for new player

#### Key Design Patterns:
- **State Management**: Uses Zustand store for `isWordRevealed` state
- **Custom Hooks**: `usePressAndHold` encapsulates all press/touch logic
- **Separation of Concerns**: Visual (Text) separated from interaction (Circle)
- **Overlapping Components**: Both components use `absolute inset-0` for full overlap
- **Event Handling**: Supports both mouse and touch events

#### Benefits:
- **Security**: Word only revealed after deliberate 1s hold
- **Modularity**: Components can be styled/animated independently
- **Reusability**: `usePressAndHold` hook can be used elsewhere
- **Clean State**: Word reveal state managed centrally in game store

### Smart Sync Strategy for Themes
The app implements an intelligent sync mechanism between Zustand (local state) and the backend to handle:
- **Instant UI updates** - Local changes appear immediately via Zustand
- **Background sync** - Fetches backend data without blocking the UI
- **Multi-client sync** - Detects changes from other clients or direct backend modifications
- **Conflict resolution** - Backend is source of truth, but preserves user experience

#### Implementation Details:
1. **Zustand Priority**: UI always uses Zustand store as primary data source (instant updates)
2. **Background Sync**: Pages fetch backend data on mount and every 30 seconds
3. **Smart Merge**: `syncThemes()` compares backend vs local:
   - Detects additions (themes on backend not in local)
   - Detects deletions (themes in local not on backend)
   - Detects updates (same ID but different name/type)
   - Only updates store if changes detected
4. **Persistence**: Themes cached in localStorage with `lastSynced` timestamp
5. **Loading States**: Separate `isLoading` (initial) and `isSyncing` (background) flags

#### Benefits:
- No loading spinners on navigation (uses cached data)
- Real-time sync when backend changes externally
- Optimistic updates feel instant
- Handles offline scenarios gracefully

### State Management Architecture
```typescript
// Proposed Zustand store structure
interface GameStore {
  // State
  playerNum: number;
  theme: string | null;
  currentPlayer: number;
  liarPosition: number;
  word: string | null;
  stage: GameStage;
  
  // Actions
  setPlayerNum: (num: number) => void;
  setTheme: (theme: string) => void;
  startGame: () => void;
  nextPlayer: () => void;
  resetGame: () => void;
}

interface UIStore {
  // State
  skin: SkinType;
  isLoading: boolean;
  error: string | null;
  
  // Actions
  setSkin: (skin: SkinType) => void;
  setLoading: (loading: boolean) => void;
  setError: (error: string | null) => void;
}
```

## Development Workflow

### Parallel Development Setup
```bash
# Terminal 1: Current Next.js frontend
cd frontend
npm run dev  # Port 3000

# Terminal 2: New Vite frontend
cd frontend-vite
npm run dev  # Port 5173
```

### Testing Strategy
1. **Component-by-component testing**: Test each migrated component in isolation
2. **Page-level testing**: Ensure complete pages work as expected
3. **Flow testing**: Test complete user journeys
4. **A/B testing**: Compare old vs new implementation

## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Challenges
1. **Route handling differences**: Next.js App Router vs React Router
2. **SSR/SSG loss**: Moving from Next.js to pure client-side
3. **Image optimization**: Next.js Image component benefits
4. **API route migration**: If using Next.js API routes

### Mitigation Strategies
- Keep detailed testing checklist
- Maintain feature parity document
- Regular comparison testing
- Incremental rollout capability

## Success Metrics
- ✅ All features working identically to current version
- ✅ Performance equal or better (initial load, interactions)
- ✅ Bundle size reasonable (<500KB gzipped)
- ✅ TypeScript coverage 100%
- ✅ No runtime errors in production
- ✅ All tests passing

## Timeline Estimate
- **Phase 1-2**: 2-3 days (Setup & Infrastructure)
- **Phase 3-4**: 5-7 days (Components & Pages)
- **Phase 5-6**: 3-4 days (Features & Testing)
- **Phase 7-8**: 2-3 days (Validation & Cutover)

**Total: 12-17 days** (assuming full-time development)

## Next Steps
1. Review and approve this plan
2. Set up the Vite project structure
3. Begin Phase 1 implementation
4. Create detailed component migration checklist
