Use tmux-based scripts to manage Liar Game services:

- `./restart.sh` - Stops existing services and restarts both backend (port 8001) and frontend (port 3000) in separate tmux sessions
- `./status.sh` - Shows service health, port status, HTTP endpoint checks, and recent logs
- `./stop.sh` - Gracefully stops all services and cleans up ports
