Game Instructions

Welcome to the LIAR Game!

1. Setup
After choosing a category, you pass the phone around in a circle.
- Each player silently reads the word on the screen.
- The word will be the same for every player except the liar, who will read "You’re the liar" instead of the word.
- Once all players have seen their word, put the phone away.

2. Making Statements
One by one, players make a short statement describing the word (without saying the word itself).
- The liar’s goal is to blend in, making their statement sound natural and unsuspicious so they are not identified.

3. Discussion
After everyone has spoken, the group discusses who they think the liar might be.
- If everyone agrees on a suspect, move to the next step.
- If there are multiple suspects or no agreement, play another round of statements before deciding.

4. Reveal & Scoring
- If the group guesses the wrong liar, the real liar earns 2 points.
- If the group guesses correctly, the liar then has a chance to guess the secret word.
  - If they guess correctly, the liar earns 2 points.
  - If they guess wrong, all other players earn 1 point each.

Example:
Category: Food | Word: Cherry

Player 1: "I am sweet."
Player 2 (liar): "I am expensive."
Player 3: "People eat me in the summer."
Player 4: "My milkshake brings all the boys to the yard."

At this point, players can either accuse someone of being the liar or continue another round for more clues.
